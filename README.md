# DSS - Systemic Barriers to Agricultural Water Reuse

This repository contains an interactive Decision Support System (DSS) developed in Python (Dash) to prioritize and simulate systemic barriers to agricultural water reuse in Brazil.

## Features

- SHAP-based systemic influence analysis  
- Network centrality metrics (Out-degree, Betweenness)  
- Composite prioritization scoring  
- PCA-based clustering and typology visualization  
- Interactive “What-if” simulation of barrier removal

## About

This DSS was developed as a companion tool to the academic study:

**"Explaining Systemic Barriers to Agricultural Water Reuse in Brazil Using SHAP and Cross-Impact Modeling"**

It supports interactive analysis and scenario simulation to prioritize institutional, governance and technical constraints in water reuse strategies under uncertainty.
